        Every year, as if following a secret calendar, more than a million wildebeest, zebras, and gazelles march across the East African savanna. 
        Why do they go? Well, imagine if your dinner kept walking away — you'd chase it too! The rains draw them north, painting the dry land green again. 
        Rivers swell, grass grows, and suddenly, the plain becomes a moving feast. From above, the herds look like dark ribbons weaving across a sea of gold. 
        It's not just a journey; it's the heartbeat of the savanna. Yet danger lurks — crocodiles in the rivers, lions in the shadows — reminding us that here, 
        every step is a gamble in the great game of survival.

      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to the Maasai Mara — nature's grand stage, where everyone has a role to play. 
        The wildebeest are the restless travelers, zebras the striped companions, and lions... well, 
        the “dinner critics.” Here, the land breathes with rhythm: rain brings life, drought tests endurance. 
        Each species, from tiny dung beetles to towering elephants, is part of a delicate balance. 
        When the herds arrive, predators sharpen their senses, knowing that the feast — and the challenge — has begun. 
        The Mara is not just a place on the map; it's a living story of hunger, hope, and harmony, rewritten every season beneath the blazing African sun.
